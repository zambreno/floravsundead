# Specify the run-time commands. The valid commands are:
# place, fire, goto.
# Each command can be made optional based on your team's condition. Prefix the
# instruction with "if" or "if not" and query the state, from the following options:
# ready, alive, damaged, eaten, hit, score, winning, empty.
# Each command can also be identified with a label that can be the target of a "goto"
# command. Execution will begin with the "Start: " command.

# Strategy: continued firing loop (because why not?), move P21, P22 as last defense
