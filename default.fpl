# Specify the run-time commands. The valid commands are:
# place, fire, goto. 
# Each command can be made optional based on your team's condition. Prefix the 
# instruction with "if" or "if not" and query the state, from the following options:
# damaged, eaten, hit, score. 
# Each command can also be identified with a label that can be the target of a "goto" 
# command. Execution will begin with the "Start: " command.

L2: if damaged, move P3 1, 3

# Loop back to the start.
